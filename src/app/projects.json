        "description": "Developed a custom wrapper around the highway-env intersection scenario to evaluate and benchmark reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous driving. Implemented a reward structure focused on safety and route completion using Python and Gymnasium. Trained and compared DQN, REINFORCE, A2C, SAC, and PPO, achieving strong results within 200k training steps.",
